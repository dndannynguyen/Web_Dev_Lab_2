        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <p>According to a recent census conducted by Statistics Canada in 2021, the city of Vancouver boasts a population of 662,248 individuals, residing in 305,336 out of a total of 328,347 private dwellings units. This represents an increase of 4.9% from the 2016 census. As the eighth largest city in Canada and the fourth largest in Western Canada, Vancouver is known for its high population density of 5,749.7/km2, making it the most densely populated municipality in Canada with a population of over 5,000 residents.

            Furthermore, the Greater Vancouver census metropolitan area, which includes Vancouver, has a population of 2,642,825, representing a change of 7.3% from the 2016 census. This makes it the third most populous metropolitan area in the country and the most populous in Western Canada. It is also worth noting that approximately 75% of the individuals living in the Metro Vancouver area reside outside of Vancouver.
            
            Additionally, the 2021 census also reported that 42.2% of Vancouver's population is made up of immigrants, with the top countries of origin being China, Philippines, Hong Kong, India, United Kingdom, Vietnam, Taiwan, United States, Iran, and South Korea. These statistics demonstrate that Vancouver is a diverse and multicultural city, with a significant proportion of its population consisting of individuals who have immigrated from other countries.

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>Vancouver's streetcar system was established on June 28, 1890, running from the Granville Street Bridge to Westminster Avenue. The Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company soon after began operating Canada's first interurban line between the two cities and extended it to Chilliwack in 1910. Another line, the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway, was leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the British Columbia Electric Railway in 1905, running from the Granville Street Bridge to Steveston via Kerrisdale, which helped spur development in residential neighborhoods outside the city center. The British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) operated the urban and interurban rail system from 1897 until 1958, when the system was replaced with trolley and gasoline/diesel buses. The BCER then became the core of the newly created, publicly-owned BC Hydro. Currently, Vancouver has the second-largest trolleybus fleet in North America, following San Francisco.
           <br> In the 1970s and 1980s, city councils in Vancouver implemented a long-term plan which prohibited the construction of freeways. As a result, the only major freeway within the city limits is Highway 1, which passes through the northeastern corner of the city. Despite population growth and an increase in the number of cars, the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by dail commuters have decreased since the early 1990s. Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with this trend. Despite an increase in journey time per vehicle and growing traffic volume, there are 7% fewer cars making trips into the downtown area. In 2012, Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in Canada and the second-worst in North America, behind Los Angeles. As of 2013, Vancouver now has the worst traffic congestion in North America. This trend is partly due to city planning efforts to reduce traffic and promote environmental campaigns, which have made it more difficult and expensive to commute by car, and more beneficial to use mass transit and cycling.
           <br> TransLink is responsible for the management of roads and public transportation within Metro Vancouver, taking over the functions of BC Transit, which had previously taken over the transit functions of BC Hydro. It offers services such as bus service, including the RapidBus express service, a passenger and bicycle ferry service (SeaBus), an automated rapid transit service called SkyTrain, and a commuter rail service called West Coast Express. As of 2017, Vancouver's SkyTrain system operates on three lines, the Millennium Line, the Expo Line, and the Canada Line, with a total of 53 stations. However, only 20 of these stations are located within the city limits of Vancouver, with the remaining stations in adjacent suburbs. Several of the city's major tourist attractions, including English Bay, Stanley Park, the Vancouver Aquarium, the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology, and Kitsilano, are not currently connected to this rapid transit system.
